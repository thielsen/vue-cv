skills:
- name: Works well under pressure
  description: Having spent the last 10 years working in the financial environment, most recently in high frequency trading, I am used to working in high pressure environments with tight deadlines for project delivery and for troubleshooting of misbehaving systems. This also often involves dealing with highly emotional people who need their infrastructure working so there is also a great deal of diplomacy involved whilst not allowing this to distract from the end goal.
- name: Analytical Approach
  description: Designing low latency networks involves eking out every bit of performance from devices. Often when evaluating hardware getting down to the ASIC level is required and understanding how this will interact with other parts of the network. This involves reading, digesting and finding the links between vast amounts of information along with an understanding of how higher level protocols will be affected.
- name: Quick learner
  description: Working in fast paced technology roles has meant that an ability to quickly pick up new technologies has been a necessity. Many previous clients have required to be on the bleeding edge so we would often be one of the first to deploy new technologies, often working along vendors to resolve bugs as we hit them. In addition I've had to maintain my certifications either through continuing professional development or by sitting new qualifying exams meaning constant learning has been required throughout my career.
- name: Motivated self starter
  description: I've always taken charge of my own career and not just followed the path it takes me. Through self study and home labbing I managed to pass two of the most respected certifications in networking and security, the CCIE and the CISSP. Most recently my decision to spend 3 months at Makers studying coding full time is further evidence of this.
- name: Technical skillset
  description: Having worked in various roles in operations, engineering, pre-sales and architecture over my career, starting on desktop support and working my way up via various infrastructure teams to a network and security focus I have a large amount of technical skills in various disciplines and an understanding of how the big technology picture fits together.
